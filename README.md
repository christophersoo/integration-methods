# RIEMANN INTEGRATION VS MONTE CARLO INTEGRATION WITH JUPYTER NOTEBOOK

## DESCRIPTION
This project aims to compare the two popular methods of integrating a function.
Namely the riemann integration and the monte carlo integration. Where one uses a 
definitive process and the other uses a stochastic process. This project will then
evaluate the error rate for both methods and evaluate their appropriateness, advantages
and disadvantages
