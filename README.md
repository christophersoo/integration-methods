# RIEMANN INTEGRATION VS MONTE CARLO INTEGRATION WITH JUPYTER NOTEBOOK

## DESCRIPTION
This project aims to compare the two popular methods of integrating a function.
Namely the riemann integration and the monte carlo integration. Where one uses a 
definitive process and the other uses a stochastic process. This project will then
evaluate the error rate for both methods and evaluate their appropriateness, advantages
and disadvantages

## INSTALLATION
To install this ipynb project, simply navigate to the file called "CHRISTOPHERSOO_Project2_Option2".
Since there are some animation in the file I do not recommend you to preview it directly on the github website.
As it will cause some lag and static movements. I do recommend you to instead download the file and run it in either an IDE
such as pycharm or VScode, or run it in a jupyter notebook or other derivations such as Spyder or Google Colab.
